This era of regression allows us to evaluate the impact of the Foundation's Arcanist policies over the past decade in a more objective way.\n\n    Therefore, I will offer as much support as I can. But we still know nothing about the temporal disasters; you are facing unknown dangers. Come back alive.\n\n\n                                                              Juraj   "

If the summoned 6-star is not one of your selected, the next 6-star summon will guarantee one of your selected.\nFor 5-star summons, all the current rate up characters have equal rates.\n\n{Special Rules}\nIn banner <color=#B65223>[▩1%s]</color>, if you have not obtained any 6-star character after 60 consecutive summons, the rate of summoning a 6-star character in the next summon will rise from 1.5% to 4%. If you still have not obtained any 6-star character, then every next summon that doesn't grant a 6-star character will increase the rate by 2.5%.\nEvery 70 summons guarantees one 6-star character.\nP. S. After you have obtained a 6-star character, the rate of summoning 6-star characters in <color=#B65223>[▩1%s]</color> type events will be reset to 1.5%.\n\n{Duplicate Characters}\n\nRegardless of sources, including but not limited to banners, Bank, and system gifts:\n\n▪ When you obtain the same 6-star character for the 2nd-6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>12</color> Albums of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>28</color> Albums of the Lost every time.\n\n▪ When you obtain the same 5-star character for the 2nd-6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>3</color> Albums of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>7</color> Albums of the Lost every time.\n\n▪ When you obtain the same 4-star character for the 2nd-6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>8</color> Tracks of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>12</color> Tracks of the Lost every time.\n\n▪ When you obtain the same 3-star character for the 2nd-6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>4</color> Tracks of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>7</color> Tracks of the Lost every time.\n\n▪ When you obtain the same 2-star character for the 2nd-6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>3</color> Tracks of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>5</color> Tracks of the Lost every time."

During the event, 6-star characters <color=#B65223>[upname=1]</color> and <color=#B65223>[upname=2]</color> enjoy rate up!\n\n<color=#B65223>[▩1%s]</color> is a <color=#B65223>[Time-Limited Event Banner]</color> and does NOT share guarantee count with other similar banners.\n\nThis is a <color=#B65223>[▩1%s]</color> banner. The guarantee count is calculated independently and is NOT shared with other similar banners.\n\nAfter the event, the guarantee count of <color=#B65223>[▩1%s]</color> will be cleared and will NOT carry over to other similar banners.\n\n▪  In this event, each of the first three \"Summon x10\" attempts consumes Unilog x8 only.\n▪  Every 10 summons guarantees at least one 4-star or higher character.\n▪  Generally, the basic rate applies to all characters. Under certain circumstances, such as Rate Up or Guarantee, please refer to the specific rules.\n\n{Summon Rates}\n\nIn banner <color=#B65223>[▩1%s]</color>:\nBasic rate of summoning 6-star characters: 1.5%. Overall rate (including Guarantee): 2.36%;\nBasic rate of summoning 5-star characters: 8.5%;\nBasic rate of summoning 4-star characters: 40%;\nBasic rate of summoning 3-star characters: 45%;\nBasic rate of summoning 2-star characters: 5%.\n\nFor 6-star summons, there's a 70% chance to get one of the rate-up characters, with both having equal chances. If the summoned 6-star is not one of the rate-up characters, the next 6-star summon will guarantee a rate-up character.\n\nFor 5-star summons, all characters have equal rates.\n\n{Special Rules}\n\nIn banner <color=#B65223>[▩1%s]</color>, if you have not obtained any 6-star character after 60 consecutive summons, the rate of summoning a 6-star character in the next summon will rise from 1.5% to 4%. If you still have not obtained any 6-star character, then every next summon that doesn't grant a 6-star character will increase the rate by 2.5%.\n\nEvery 70 summons guarantees 1 6-star character.\n\nP.S. After you have obtained a 6-star character, the rate of summoning 6-star characters in <color=#B65223>[▩1%s]</color> type events will be reset to 1.5%.\n\n{Duplicate Characters}\n\nRegardless of source, including but not limited to banners, Bank, and system gifts:\n\n▪  When you obtain the same 6-star character for the 2nd–6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>12</color> Albums of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>28</color> Albums of the Lost every time.\n\n▪  When you obtain the same 5-star character for the 2nd–6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>3</color> Albums of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>7</color> Albums of the Lost every time.\n\n▪  When you obtain the same 4-star character for the 2nd–6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>8</color> Tracks of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>12</color> Tracks of the Lost every time.\n\n▪  When you obtain the same 3-star character for the 2nd–6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>4</color> Tracks of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>7</color> Tracks of the Lost every time.\n\n▪  When you obtain the same 2-star character for the 2nd–6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>3</color> Tracks of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>5</color> Tracks of the Lost every time."

This is a <color=#B65223>[Time-limited Character Banner]</color> and shares guarantee count with other similar banners. During the event, 6-star character <color=#B65223>[upname=1]</color> and 5-star character <color=#B65223>[upname=2]</color> enjoy rate up!\n\n▪ In this event, every 10 summons guarantee at least one 4-star or higher character.\n\n▪ Generally, the basic rate applies to all characters. Under certain circumstances, such as Rate Up or Guarantee, please refer to the specific rules.\n\n{Summon Rates}\n\nIn banner [▩1%s]:\n\nBasic rate of summoning 6-star characters: <color=#B65223>▩3%s</color>. Overall rate (including Guarantee): <color=#B65223>2.36%</color>;\nBasic rate of summoning 5-star characters: <color=#B65223>▩4%s</color>;\nBasic rate of summoning 4-star characters: <color=#B65223>▩5%s</color>;\nBasic rate of summoning 3-star characters: <color=#B65223>▩6%s</color>;\nBasic rate of summoning 2-star characters: <color=#B65223>▩7%s</color>.\n\nFor 6-star summons, there's a <color=#B65223>50%</color> chance to get the rate-up character, <color=#B65223>[upname=1]</color>.

It shares the 6-star character guarantee count with other similar banners, and the guarantee count will not be cleared after the banner expires. Both the count and the rate bonus it brings will carry over to the next [Time-limited Character Banner].\n\nP. S. After you have obtained a 6-star character, the rate of summoning 6-star characters in [Time-limited Character Banner] events will be reset to <color=#B65223>1.5%</color>.\n\n{Duplicate Characters}\n\nRegardless of sources, including but not limited to banners, Bank, and system gifts:\n\n▪ When you obtain the same 6-star character for the 2nd-6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>12</color> Albums of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>28</color> Albums of the Lost every time.\n\n▪ When you obtain the same 5-star character for the 2nd-6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>3</color> Albums of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>7</color> Albums of the Lost every time.\n\n▪ When you obtain the same 4-star character for the 2nd-6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>8</color> Tracks of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>12</color> Tracks of the Lost every time.\n\n▪ When you obtain the same 3-star character for the 2nd-6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>4</color> Tracks of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>7</color> Tracks of the Lost every time.\n\n▪ When you obtain the same 2-star character for the 2nd-6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>3</color> Tracks of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>5</color> Tracks of the Lost every time."

Note that you can re-select your rate-up character at any time, and doing so won't reset your guarantee count.\n<color=#B65223>[▩1%s]</color> is a <color=#B65223>[Time-Limited Event Banner]</color> and does NOT share guarantee count with other similar banners.\nRate-up 6-star Character Selection:\n[all_six_star]\nThis is a <color=#B65223>[▩1%s]</color> banner and shares the same guarantee with summoning events of the same name.\nAfter the event, the guarantee count of <color=#B65223>[▩1%s]</color> will not be cleared and will carry over to the next <color=#B65223>[▩1%s]</color> banner.\n\n▪ In this event, the first Summon x10 attempt consumes only Unilog x7.\n▪ In this event, every 10 summons guarantees at least one 4-star or higher character.\n▪ Generally, the basic rate applies to all characters. Under certain circumstances, such as Rate Up or Guarantee, please refer to the specific rules.\n\n{Summon Rates}\nIn banner <color=#B65223>[▩1%s]</color>:\nBasic rate of summoning 6-star characters: 1.5%; overall rate (including Guarantee): 2.36%.\nBasic rate of summoning 5-star characters: 8.5%.\nBasic rate of summoning 4-star characters: 40%.\nBasic rate of summoning 3-star characters: 45%.\nBasic rate of summoning 2-star characters: 5%.\n\nFor one time only, the first 6-star character you summon in this event is guaranteed to be the 6-star rate-up character you selected.\nFor subsequent 6-star summons, there's a 50% chance to get your selected 6-star rate-up character. If the summoned 6-star is not your selected 6-star rate-up character, the next 6-star summoned is guaranteed to be your selected 6-star rate-up character.\nFor 5-star summons, all 5-star characters have equal rates.\n\n{Special Rules}\nIn banner <color=#B65223>[▩1%s]</color>, if you have not obtained any 6-star character after 60 consecutive summons, the rate of summoning a 6-star character in the next summon will rise from 1.5% to 4%. If you still have not obtained any 6-star character, then every next summon that doesn't grant a 6-star character will increase the rate by 2.5%.\nEvery 70 summons guarantees one 6-star character.\nP.S. After you have obtained a 6-star character, the rate of summoning 6-star characters in <color=#B65223>[▩1%s]</color> events will be reset to 1.5%.\n\n\n{Duplicate Characters}\n\nRegardless of sources, including but not limited to banners, Bank, and system gifts:\n\n▪ When you obtain the same 6-star character for the 2nd-6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>12</color> Albums of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>28</color> Albums of the Lost every time.\n▪ When you obtain the same 5-star character for the 2nd-6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>3</color> Albums of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>7</color> Albums of the Lost every time.\n▪ When you obtain the same 4-star character for the 2nd-6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>8</color> Tracks of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>12</color> Tracks of the Lost every time.\n▪ When you obtain the same 3-star character for the 2nd-6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>4</color> Tracks of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>7</color> Tracks of the Lost every time.\n▪ When you obtain the same 2-star character for the 2nd-6th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>1</color> Artifice of the character and <color=#B65223>3</color> Tracks of the Lost every time; starting from the 7th time, the duplicate character will be converted into <color=#B65223>5</color> Tracks of the Lost every time.\n"
